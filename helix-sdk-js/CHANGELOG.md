# @helixid/sdk-js

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8dc8a4d: Release the changes accumulated on `main` since the last manual npm publish (0.1.7 / 0.1.1 / 0.1.1, 2026-07-11) that were never pushed to npm:

  - `HelixClient`: enterprise account-scoped mode for `signVP()`, API-key auth with a default `baseUrl`, and `delegateAuthority()`
  - Removed the account (email/password) login fallback from `HelixClient`
  - Agent self-custody retired across the SDK/CLI/MCP/LangChain surface
  - Pluggable `WalletStorage` threaded through `HelixClientOptions`; new `helix agent onboard` CLI command
